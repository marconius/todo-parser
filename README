TODO List Parser
================

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate my partial solution to the "Todo lists!" problem.

Only the `--toHtml` option is available. It is mostly complete, and relies on some assumptions listed below.

The main difficulty with this implementation was the initial idea of creating an abstract parser from scratch.
Undoubtedly, more of the tasks would be complete had time been spent on defining a formal todo markup grammar, and
employing a third-party parser generator instead.

Nevertheless, I am proud of some parts of the code, for instance the (non-standard) grammar builder using "rules".


How to install and run from a virtaulenv
------------

Requires Python 3.X


```
$ git clone https://github.com/marconius/todo-parser.git
$ cd todo-parser
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
$ pip install .
$ todo-parser --toHtml tests/todoMarkup
```

How to run automated tests
-----

```
$ python3 -m unittest tests
```

Assumptions
-----------

* The syntax of to-do list text is safe, so no syntax checking is necessary
* All output HTML is inside an `<html>` element
* Markup files end with two newlines. (this is because parser attempts to break the markup into smaller and smaller
  pieces uses regex, which can make it difficult to distinguish between elements and subelements)
