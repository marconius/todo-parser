TODO List Parser
================

Tests
-----

```
python3 -m unittest tests
```

Rules
-----

* rules are simple regex pattern
* A <text> named group can be used to extract content


Assumptions
-----------

* Biggest assumption made: there are no 3rd party parsing libraries in existence
* For now, the only way to start to-do list is with a section
* For now, we assume that the syntax of to-do list text is safe, so no syntax checking is necessary
* All output HTML is inside an `<html>` element?
* Markup files end with two newlines!

Roadmap
-------

We might want to allow nested lists, add ability to emphasize pieces
of text, maybe even add links to resources elsewhere, add new markup for adding
styles, etc.
